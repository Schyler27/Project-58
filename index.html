      <p> My favourite hobby is reading. I enjoy reading a book when I am free. I started to do it when I was four years old. The  first time I did it, I felt interested. So I kept reading. I was happy when I read a story with a happy ending. I was thrilled when I read a detective story. I enjoy reading because I like to explore the imaginative world of my favourite author, J.K. Rowling who wrote “ Harry Potter” . There are a lot of advantages of reading. Reading can make me relaxed and calm. I can also learn new vocabulary items. Then I can further improve my English. Moreover, it can give me an unlimited imagination. I can learn the different cultures and customs of other countries in the world too. I read for at least half an hour every day. I usually read at home. It also makes us disciplined in life.
